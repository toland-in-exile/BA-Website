        <h1>Who we are:</h1>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bandit Alliance is a collection of netizens from all walks of life. With few explicitly
            defining features, its more than a little difficult to describe us as anything other than... 'Us'.
            With the range of interests represented amongst even our core membership, there aren't many problems
            we couldn't solve out of our own intellectual resources.
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being said, how does one define us? Are we just a 'clan'
            of gamers? With so few of us playing concurrently in the same game? What about counselors? As often
            as we sit together and talk through life, none of us are actually trained or certified. Legally
            speaking, we can't advertise as engineers, though I would be hard pressed to find a group with 
            more knowledge and ability in that vein. Perhaps we're an autism support group. Even then, we are all
            too old for autism to have been in the public eye during our youth, though I would challenge you to
            spend an hour with us and <strong><em>not</em></strong> describe us as "High-functioning".
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I think the best and only way to describe BA is... BA. Those
            in the know, would nod their heads in understanding if you described a process as "The BA way". 
            Like-wise is there <strong><em>some</em></strong> common string that enables outsiders to tell without a shadow of
            a doubt that some new person would or would not fit perfectly into our family, with a degree of accuracy
            that borders on prescience.
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are the Bandit Alliance, and no matter where we go, what we do,
            or how we do it, we remain uniquely us, and invite everyone to swing by the den to find out if they are
            part of our family, and need only discover it!
