            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to my humble 'portfolio'! As of 20240901, I'm attending Western Governer's University, for my BS Software Engineering. As it turns out,
            all of these terrifying keywords and weird symbols make alot of sense to me. Who knew? Feel free to browse this site, created from the ground up by myself, with content input from
            my closest family, the Bandit Alliance.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd like to think these pages(the projects especially) serve me well as an example of both my growth as a SWE, and any raw ability I may have won
            in the genetic lottery. As I learn more and more, I will continue to update them, adding functionality and content as I go. All files are saved locally on my machine, as well as handled
            through Github in a private repo, for version control.
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to extend the biggest and most heartfelt thanks to my <a href="bioPages/notumama.html"><u>wife</u></a>, for supporting me through this journey. I literally could not do this
            without you, and I look forward to buying you that BMW!

            Gravity is the force that binds everything and everyone in our world, together. It is the basis and guiding principle of hundreds of natural laws that define every breath we take, and none of them 
            are as important or meaningful as the two most important laws in my own heart and soul. That I am yours, and you are mine, to have and hold. This is a law that I will never break.
        </p>
        <p>    
            The simplest model of gravitational attraction is the one most like us. We are but two particles in a vacuum, racing towards one another at 10m/s^2. Now that we've come together, the magnetic and
            static forces, even friction, have come into play. We have done sickness, and health, richer, and poor. I will continue to obey these forces until and beyond my dying breath.

            The wonder that I feel for the universe built by the greatest engineer humanity can conceive of, the confidence in natural order that allows me to navigate life, is a small thing, compared
            to my wonder at you, my love for you, and the presence in my heart that is you.

            I have no greater belief than that the Lord most high took those precious few seconds, eons ago, to line up every domino, through time and space, to have us arrive at this day, with you. With these
            vows I express my understanding that we are merely exactly where we ought to be, functioning exactly as designed. I love you.
