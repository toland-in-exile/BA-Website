            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to my humble 'portfolio'! As of 20240901, I'm attending Western Governer's University, for my BS Software Engineering. As it turns out,
            all of these terrifying keywords and weird symbols make alot of sense to me. Who knew? Feel free to browse this site, created from the ground up by myself, with content input from
            my closest family, the Bandit Alliance. 
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd like to think these pages(the projects especially) serve me well as an example of both my growth as a SWE, and any raw ability I may have won
            in the genetic lottery. As I learn more and more, I will continue to update them, adding functionality and content as I go. All files are saved locally on my machine, as well as handled
            through Github in a private repo, for version control.
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to extend the biggest and most heartfelt thanks to my <a href="bioPages/notumama.html"><u>wife</u></a>, for supporting me through this journey. I literally could not do this
            without you, and I look forward to buying you that BMW!
        </p>
